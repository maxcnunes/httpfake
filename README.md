httpfake provides is a simple wrapper for [httptest](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest/) with a handful chainable API for setting up handlers to a fake server. This package is aimed to be used in tests where the original external server must not be reached. Instead is used in its place a fake server which can be configured to handle any request as desired.

## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/voronelf/httpfake
```

or

```
govendor fetch github.com/voronelf/httpfake
```

> If possible give preference for using vendor. This way the version is locked up as a dependency in your project.

## Changelog

See [Releases](https://github.com/voronelf/httpfake/releases) for detailed history changes.

## API

See [godoc reference](https://godoc.org/github.com/voronelf/httpfake) for detailed API documentation.

## Assertions

There are built-in methods you can use to make assertions about requests to your HTTP handlers. The currently
supported assertions are:

* Presence of query parameters
* Query parameter and its expected value
* Presence of HTTP headers
* HTTP header and its expected value
* The expected body of your request

[WithTesting](https://godoc.org/github.com/voronelf/httpfake#WithTesting) **must** be provided as a server
option when creating the test server if you intend to set request assertions. Failing to set the option
when using request assertions will result in a panic.

### Custom Assertions

You can also provide your own assertions by creating a type that implements the
[Assertor interface](https://godoc.org/github.com/voronelf/httpfake#Assertor) or utilizing the
[CustomAssertor function type](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/voronelf/httpfake#CustomAssertor). The `Assertor.Log` method will be
called for each assertion before it's processed. The `Assertor.Error` method will only be called if the
`Assertor.Assert` method returns an error.

## Examples

For a full list of examples please check out the [functional_tests folder](/functional_tests).

```go
// initialize the faker server
// will bring up a httptest.Server
fakeService := httpfake.New()

// bring down the server once we
// finish running our tests
defer fakeService.Close()

// register a handler for our fake service
fakeService.NewHandler().
  Get("/users").
  Reply(200).
  BodyString(`[{"username": "dreamer"}]`)

// run a real http request to that server
res, err := http.Get(fakeService.ResolveURL("/users"))
```
